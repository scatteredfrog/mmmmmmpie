        Jim and Sean, shown here discussing which games they'll <span class='strike'>look up on 
            Wikipedia</span>
        research diligently so they can have an intelligent discussion on the next episode, 
        twice weekly try to fulfill their mission to make Tinkle Pit a household name.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        In each episode, Sean and Jim discuss two (2) classic arcade games and reveal a common 
        theme. Because they're longtime classic console gamers, the hosts also give a home gamer's 
        perspective on the games they discuss. (And because both are from the Chicago area,
        there's a bit of provinciality as well.)<br />

        Oh...did we mention...Tinkle Pit?
